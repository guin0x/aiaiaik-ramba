# preprocessing

This folder contains the modules (as <code>*.py</code> and <code>*.ipynb</code> files) used for the preprocessing of the data.

- <code>images_analysis.py</code>: load and analyse the images. You actually do not need most of these functions. I suggest you to use the <code>show_image_array</code> function to visualise the images.
- <code>satellite_analysis_pre.py</code>: preprocess the satellite images.
- <code>transform_image.ipynb</code>: Transform & reshape NDVI images to match the binary image. Some functions were adjusted compared to `images_analysis.py`.
